# Slide 1: Reddit Origin Story
- template: split-wide
  title: The Post That Started It All
  image: assets/reddit-origin.jpeg
  image_alt: "Reddit post about boyfriend's soup tube business idea"
  image_fit: contain
  text: "92% upvoted. 4,000 comments. One boyfriend with a dream — and a PowerPoint."
  transition: fade
  show_footer: false
  notes: |
    Open with the Reddit post. Let them read it.
    The crowd always chuckles at this one.
    "Tube just zings better" — that's our brand DNA.
    Let it breathe. The humor disarms the room.

# Slide 2: Transition
- template: center
  text: "This is what Chad Brotherton's pitch could've looked like."
  transition: fade
  show_footer: false
  notes: |
    Brief pause. Let the audience shift gears.
    Then we launch into the full pitch deck.

# Slide 3: Title
- template: title
  title: "🍜 SoupTube"
  subtitle: "Series A — Redefining Last-Mile Nourishment"
  author: "Chad Brotherton, CEO & Founder"

  transition: fade
  transition_speed: slow
  notes: |
    Deep breath. Make eye contact with the lead partner.
    Open with conviction — this is the most important meal delivery
    infrastructure play of the decade. Let the logo breathe.

# Slide 4: The Problem
- template: hero
  title: The Last Mile of Soup is Broken
  text: "84 million Americans eat soup every day.<br><br>Not one of them enjoys getting it home."
  image: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1555396273-367ea4eb4db5?w=1920&h=1080&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format"
  transition: zoom
  show_footer: false
  notes: |
    Hit them with the stat. Let the image do the work.
    84 million — that's more than Netflix subscribers.
    The problem isn't soup. The problem is logistics.
    Pause for effect before moving to the opportunity.

# Slide 5: Section — The Opportunity
- template: section
  title: The Opportunity
  subtitle: "A $247B market hiding in plain sight"
  background_image: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1477959858617-67f85cf4f1df?w=1920&h=1080&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format"
  transition: fade
  notes: |
    Transition into the market size. Keep energy high.
    This is where we show them the money.

# Slide 6: TAM/SAM/SOM
- template: metrics
  title: Total Addressable Market
  background_image: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1637345158353-40607a208d46?w=1920&h=1080&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format"
  fragment: fade-up
  metrics:
    - value: "$247B"
      label: TAM
      context: "U.S. soup & hot food delivery"
      color: amber
    - value: "$43B"
      label: SAM
      context: "Urban subscription food services"
      color: icy
    - value: "$8.2B"
      label: SOM
      context: "Tube-accessible metro areas"
      color: mint
  notes: |
    Walk through each number deliberately.
    TAM is the entire soup-adjacent market. Every bowl, every cup, every thermos.
    SAM narrows to urban subscription — our actual arena.
    SOM is conservative. 50 cities with existing underground infrastructure.
    Investors always divide your SOM by 10, so we padded it.

# Slide 7: Product Introduction
- template: image-overlay
  title: Introducing SoupTube
  image: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1649956739904-9b5e3618c626?w=1920&h=1080&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format"
  position: bottom-right
  items:
    - "Centralized TubeHub kitchens in every borough"
    - "Pressurized food-grade pneumatic tubes to every building"
    - "4-minute farm-to-bowl delivery, 24/7"
    - "Starting at $89/month — unlimited soup"
  notes: |
    This is the reveal moment. Let the image land first.
    Emphasize the word TUBE — not pipe. Tube just zings better.
    Four minutes. Say it twice. Let them do the math on DoorDash.
    The unlimited angle always gets a reaction.

# Slide 8: How It Works
- template: funnel
  title: The SoupTube Pipeline
  fragment: fade-up
  stages:
    - label: TubeHub Kitchen
      text: "Michelin-trained chefs prepare 47 signature soups in centralized hubs"
    - label: Pressurized Tubes
      text: "Food-grade pneumatic network delivers at 60mph through 8-inch tubes"
    - label: SoupPort Terminal
      text: "Wall-mounted receiving unit in every subscriber apartment"
    - label: Customer Bowl
      text: "Hot soup, perfectly portioned, ready in 4 minutes flat"
  notes: |
    Walk through each stage. This is our technical moat.
    TubeHub — think ghost kitchen meets Willy Wonka.
    The tubes are the magic. 60 miles per hour. Food-grade stainless.
    SoupPort is the consumer touchpoint. It's like a Nest thermostat but for soup.
    End on the bowl. Always end on the bowl.

# Slide 9: Competitive Comparison
- template: comparison
  title: SoupTube vs. The Status Quo
  left_header: Traditional Delivery
  right_header: SoupTube
  highlight: right
  fragment: fade-up
  background_image: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1620418025834-f4379baf1de9?w=1920&h=1080&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format"
  rows:
    - left: "35–55 min delivery"
      left_icon: "bad"
      right: "4 min via pressurized tube"
      right_icon: "good"
    - left: "$4.99 delivery + fees"
      left_icon: "bad"
      right: "$0 marginal cost per delivery"
      right_icon: "good"
    - left: "Arrives lukewarm at best"
      left_icon: "bad"
      right: "Thermal-sealed at 185°F"
      right_icon: "good"
    - left: "Styrofoam containers"
      left_icon: "bad"
      right: "Zero packaging waste"
      right_icon: "good"
  notes: |
    Let each row reveal. Give them time to read.
    The temperature point always lands — everyone's gotten cold delivery soup.
    Zero packaging waste is our ESG angle. Funds love ESG.
    Don't say "disrupting" — say "replacing the entire paradigm."

# Slide 10: Section — Traction
- template: section
  title: Traction
  subtitle: "From first tube to product-market fit"
  background_image: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1555424681-b0ecf4fe19a5?w=1920&h=1080&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format"
  transition: fade
  notes: |
    Pivot to proof. We're not just an idea — we have real numbers.
    Brooklyn pilot has been running 18 months. Real subscribers. Real soup.

# Slide 11: Traction Metrics (Projections)
- template: metrics
  title: "Year 1 Projections"
  fragment: fade-up
  metrics:
    - value: "5,000"
      label: Subscriber Target
      context: "Brooklyn launch, 12-month goal"
      color: mint
    - value: "95%+"
      label: Retention Goal
      context: "vs. 84% meal kit industry avg"
      color: coral
    - value: "$119"
      label: Target ARPU
      context: "Blended across all tiers"
      color: icy
    - value: "47"
      label: Launch Soups
      context: "Curated by Chef Antoine Dubois"
      color: amber
  notes: |
    These are projections, not actuals — be upfront about that.
    5,000 subscribers in Brooklyn alone is conservative for our density model.
    95% retention is ambitious but achievable — the product is literally in your wall.
    47 soups at launch. We tested 200. Only the best made the cut.

# Slide 12: Customer Testimonial
- template: quote
  quote: "When I heard that I could get my soup via a tube, instead of having to carry those cans home... I thought to myself: This is brilliant!"
  author: Random Person
  author_title: "Walmart Soup Aisle, Bensonhurst"
  background_image: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1604719312566-8912e9227c6a?w=1920&h=1080&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format"
  transition: fade
  notes: |
    Let the quote breathe. Don't talk over it.
    This is a real conversation Chad overheard. You can't make this up.
    "Through a tube" — the market is telling us what it wants.
    If anyone laughs, lean into it. The joy is the product.

# Slide 13: Section — Business Model
- template: section
  title: Business Model
  subtitle: "How SoupTube captures value at every layer"
  background_image: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1554224155-6726b3ff858f?w=1920&h=1080&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format"
  transition: fade
  notes: |
    Now we show them the money machine.
    Three layers — consumer, infrastructure, enterprise.
    Each one compounds the other.

# Slide 14: Revenue Model (Three Columns)
- template: three-columns
  title: Three Revenue Layers
  fragment: fade-in
  background_image: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1460925895917-afdab827c52f?w=1920&h=1080&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format"
  col1_title: "Consumer"
  col1_items:
    - "Basic — $89/mo (1 soup/day)"
    - "Premium — $149/mo (2 soups + brunch bisque)"
    - "Family — $229/mo (4 soups + kids menu)"
  col2_title: "Infrastructure"
  col2_items:
    - "SoupPort install — $499/unit"
    - "Building partnerships — rev share with property managers"
    - "12% rent premium for SoupTube buildings"
  col3_title: "Enterprise"
  col3_items:
    - "Campus licensing — hospitals, universities, offices"
    - "White-label TubeHub for restaurant brands"
    - "One hospital = 3,000 daily deliveries"
  notes: |
    Consumer is the engine — recurring revenue.
    Most people upgrade to Premium within 60 days. The brunch bisque is addictive.
    Infrastructure is the flywheel — B2B revenue that scales with the network.
    Enterprise is the sleeper. One hospital contract = 3,000 daily deliveries.

# Slide 15: Unit Economics
- template: table
  title: Unit Economics Per Subscriber
  columns:
    - "Metric"
    - "Current (Brooklyn)"
    - "At Scale (50 Cities)"
  rows:
    - ["Monthly ARPU", "$119", "$134"]
    - ["COGS (ingredients)", "($31)", "($24)"]
    - ["Tube maintenance", "($18)", "($8)"]
    - ["Depreciation", "($12)", "($7)"]
    - ["Gross margin", "49%", "71%"]
    - ["CAC", "$340", "$180"]
    - ["LTV (24-mo)", "$4,284", "$6,528"]
    - ["LTV:CAC", "12.6x", "36.3x"]
  notes: |
    This is the slide that closes deals.
    49% gross margin TODAY. In Brooklyn. With artisanal ingredients.
    At scale, we hit 71% because tube maintenance costs plummet with density.
    LTV:CAC of 12.6x is already best-in-class. At scale, 36.3x is PayPal territory.
    Pause on the LTV:CAC line. Let them absorb it.
    If they push on depreciation, remind them tubes last 40 years. This isn't a scooter.

# Slide 16: Expansion Timeline
- template: timeline
  title: Path to 50 Cities by 2029
  fragment: fade-in
  background_image: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1449824913935-59a10b8d2000?w=1920&h=1080&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format"
  events:
    - date: "2026"
      title: Brooklyn Expansion
      text: "10,000 subscribers, 4 TubeHub kitchens, full borough coverage"
    - date: "2027"
      title: NYC Metro
      text: "Manhattan, Queens, Jersey City — 50,000 subscribers"
    - date: "2028"
      title: Tri-State + Boston
      text: "150,000 subscribers, first franchise TubeHub partnerships"
    - date: "2029"
      title: 50 Cities Nationwide
      text: "500,000 subscribers, IPO-ready, international licensing talks"
  notes: |
    2026 is about proving density economics in Brooklyn.
    2027 we cross the river. Manhattan is the beachhead for national press.
    2028 is the franchise inflection — partners build TubeHubs, we license the network.
    2029: half a million subscribers, IPO pipeline, and we start fielding calls from Tokyo.
    Don't say "aggressive timeline" — say "disciplined expansion."

# Slide 17: The Ask
- template: hero
  title: "$15M Series A"
  color: "#0f172a"
  transition: zoom
  transition_speed: slow
  show_footer: false
  box_title: Use of Funds
  box_items:
    - "40% — Tube network buildout (Brooklyn + Manhattan)"
    - "25% — TubeHub kitchen buildout (3 new locations)"
    - "20% — Engineering (AI soup routing, predictive demand)"
    - "15% — Go-to-market (brand, partnerships, PR)"
  notes: |
    This is the money slide. Slow zoom in. Dark background. Gravitas.
    40% goes into the tubes. The tubes ARE the business.
    AI soup routing — this is our algorithmic moat. Predict what soup
    someone wants before they know they want it.
    15% GTM is lean. The product markets itself. Soup from a wall is inherently viral.

# Slide 18: The Team
- template: split-wide
  title: The Founding Team
  image: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1556910103-1c02745aae4d?w=1280&h=1080&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format"
  image_alt: "Professional kitchen team preparing food"
  items:
    - "<strong>Chad Brotherton</strong>, CEO — Ex-SpaceX propulsion + Le Cordon Bleu graduate"
    - "<strong>Maria Chen</strong>, CTO — MIT Fluid Dynamics PhD, 3 patents in pneumatic transport"
    - "<strong>David Okonkwo</strong>, COO — 12 years at Veolia Water, scaled to 40M connections"
    - "<strong>Chef Antoine Dubois</strong>, Head of Culinary — Michelin-starred, formerly Eleven Madison Park"
  notes: |
    The team slide is about credibility.
    I bring the intersection of rocket science and culinary arts. Literally.
    Maria's PhD thesis was on pneumatic food transport. She was born for this.
    David scaled water infrastructure to 40 million connections. Soup is just thicker water.
    Chef Antoine gives us the culinary credibility. His consommé alone is worth Series A.

# Slide 19: Vision / Closing
- template: image-overlay
  title: The Future is Tubed
  image: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1514565131-fce0801e5785?w=1920&h=1080&fit=crop&q=80&auto=format"
  position: bottom-left
  text: "The telephone was a tube. The internet is a tube. Water is a tube. SoupTube is the next invisible utility."
  transition: fade
  transition_speed: slow
  notes: |
    End with the vision. Let the sunset do the heavy lifting.
    The tube metaphor is everything. Every great utility started as a tube.
    Pause after "invisible utility." Hold eye contact.
    Then simply say: "We're raising $15M to tube the world."
    Don't say thank you. Say "Questions?" with supreme confidence.
